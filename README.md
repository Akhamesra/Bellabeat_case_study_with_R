# FitBit Tracker Data Analysis
In this, I have analyzed the FitBit Traceker Data generated by the FitBit smart device to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices and how can they improve it.  
### Here are the Insights/Recommendations I have made :-  

1) Majority of the participants didn't track their weight this can be due to manually inputing the data everyday. It may be appealing to users if Bellabeat offered **auto tracking for their weight** to make the process easier.  
  
2) Average daily steps are 6385 which is less for having healthy benefit, around 8000 steps per day is considered healthy. Bellabeat may **encourage/promote people to walk and exercise** for their health.  
  
3) **Adding more catagoies to track the calories burn** would help people to understand their lifestyle.  
  
4) The average sedentary minutes are 936.9 minutes (15.6 hrs). **Adding reminder to stand and move** by notification or vibration would improve the overall user experience.
